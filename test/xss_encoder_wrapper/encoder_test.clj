;; * The following characters are encoded using hexadecimal encodings: U+0000 - U+001f, ", ', \, <, &, /, >, U+007f,
;;   line separator (U+2028), paragraph separator (U+2029).
; * Any character requiring encoding is encoded as \xxx where xxx is the shortest hexadecimal representation of its
;   Unicode code point (after decoding surrogate pairs if necessary). This encoding is never zero padded. Thus, for
;   example, the tab character is encoded as \9, not \0009.
