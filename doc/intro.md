# Introduction to xss-encoder-wrapper

**@Paul** - How much, if anything, from the README.md should be pulled into here?

My experience with [ESAPI for Java](https://github.com/ESAPI/esapi-java-legacy) is that
most developers rarely look beyond the README file and the Javadoc. (I can tell that by
the sort of questions are asked about ESAPI on Stack Overflow.) I've documented the actual
code, within reason, but there's some essential stuff now in the README that I feel would
only get in the way once get XSS defense figured out.

So, I don't like all details that's in the README, but if people here don't look into the
'doc' directory, I am reluctant to drop stuff here.
