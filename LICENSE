# CODE REVIEW - @paul - Do we need anything else here for the moment? My long term goal -- if I could get management to
#                       agree, would be to release this as FOSS and ideally, get the contributors for the
#                       OWASP Java Encoder project to pick up the support, but we'll see. Baby steps. I did look at
#                       a few other Clojure libraries that claimed to provide XSS defense and almost none of them
#                       had contexts to support CSS and URI components which is why I ended up writing this wrapper.
